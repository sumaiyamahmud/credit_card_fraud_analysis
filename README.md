# Credit Card Fraud Anlysis

## Overview

This project uses python to analyze a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.


Due to confidentiality issues,  the original features and more background information about the data have not been provided. Features V1 to V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction amount. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
